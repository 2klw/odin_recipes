# odin_recipes
The first project from the Odin Project.

The objective of this project is to create a basic website displaying a few recipes. This will involve using all of the HTML skills I have learnt so far, such as working with text, lists, links and images.

This project will also allow me to practice the basic git workflow, staging and committing changes regularly with descriptive commit messages.
